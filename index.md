{: .col-md-12  .container}

Xsemantics is the successor of [XTypeS](http://xtypes.sourceforge.net) and acts as a complete replacement for it.  
Xsemantics improves on XtypeS by providing the following additional features:  

{: .col-md-12  .container}

* Complete access to Java types
* Rich syntax for rules by relying on Xtextâ€™s Xbase
* Java code generation using Eclipse building mechanisms
* Write any kind of rules including operational semantics rules for interpreters
* Generates Java code that can be used in your language for scoping and validation
