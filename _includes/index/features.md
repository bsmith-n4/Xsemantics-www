# Type Systems and Rules for Xtext Languages

Xsemantics is the successor of XTypeS and acts as a complete replacement for it.

Xsemantics improves on XtypeS by providing the following additional features:

* Complete access to Java types
* Rich syntax for rules by relying on Xtextâ€™s Xbase
* Java code generation using Eclipse building mechanisms
* Write any kind of rules including operational semantics rules for interpreters
* Generates Java code that can be used in your language for scoping and validation
